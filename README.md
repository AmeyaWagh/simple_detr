# Simple DETR (Detection Transformer)

This project provides a simplified implementation of DETR (DEtection TRansformer) in pure PyTorch without using any external transformer APIs.

## Overview

DETR is an end-to-end object detection model that uses a transformer architecture to directly predict bounding boxes and class labels for objects in an image. This implementation aims to provide a clear and straightforward version of DETR for educational and research purposes.

## Features

- Pure PyTorch implementation
- No external transformer libraries required
- Simplified architecture for easier understanding
- Object detection with bounding box predictions
